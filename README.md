A minimal example of how to create a custom node editor in Blender. 

Based off [Sverchok's](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok) approach to the problem. 

Motivated by a desire to learn the Sverchok code better so that I might be able to provide the developers with more more effective assistance improving the plugin. 

# Notes 
- Everything starts from the `__init__.py` file in the addon's root directory.
